This is a small set of standalone programs that interface with SoftLayer's
API, which we have found useful at End Point. They run on different servers,
with different API keys each having the minimum required privileges at
SoftLayer, so we've so far seen no need to make a shared library or any
separate configuration file to store the API key.
